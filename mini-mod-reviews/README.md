# Reviews
This is the reviews section of a larger project. All together it is just an MVP project to showcase a good working template for the project.

Use: [npm run migrate] to migrate table and then: [npm run seed] to seed the tables with some test data.
Will be working on intigrating faker.

Use .env file to set up port and data base url. Use .envTemplate as example.

This goes well with the rest of the project and you will to set up the servers for each one.
